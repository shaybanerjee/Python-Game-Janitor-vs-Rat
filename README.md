# Python-Game-Janitor-vs-Rat
Python Game written using the Pygame library. The Game allows the user to control an avatar (janitor) and shoot at rats that are moving at different speeds. The speeds of the rats augment as the player moves from level to level. The game even keeps track of all the kills the player has done, and a high score file reading/writing database will soon be implemented.
